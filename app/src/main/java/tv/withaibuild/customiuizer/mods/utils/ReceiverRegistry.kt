     * new keyguard controller after a theme change, a new Launcher after a rotation. Every
     * recreation runs the constructor or init hook again. Cleanup keyed on the hooked instance
     * cannot see the previous registration — that instance is gone — so each recreation used
     * to leave one more live receiver behind. The module then did the same work N times per
     * broadcast and pinned N dead Contexts.
     *
     * A process-scoped key keeps exactly one live receiver per logical registration,
     * regardless of how many times the hook fires.
     *
     * The registration and replacement sequence is atomic:
     * 1. The map is updated with a new, unique [ModuleReceiverRegistration] first.
     * 2. The previous registration (if any) is unregistered outside the map lock.
     * 3. The framework is asked to register the new receiver.
     * 4. After the framework call, the map is checked again. If another thread has replaced
     *    this registration in the meantime, this thread self-unregisters so the winner is the
     *    only tracked, active receiver.
     * 5. If the framework registration throws, only this thread's own map entry is removed.
     *
     * The registration holds the [Context] strongly because it is required for safe
     * unregistration and the key is process-scoped. Only [Context.getApplicationContext] is
     * retained to avoid pinning an Activity / View context.
