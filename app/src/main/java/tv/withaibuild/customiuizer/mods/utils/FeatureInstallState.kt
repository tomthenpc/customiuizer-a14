/**
 * Process-scoped storage of feature installation state.
 *
 * One [FeatureInstallState] object lives per process in the module's class loader.  It is keyed by
 * the stable integer [FeatureId.id] rather than by the [FeatureId] object.  This keeps lookups
 * fast and avoids the per-installer state maps that used to be created by each
 * [FeatureInstallRegistry].
 *
 * The current implementation uses a plain [HashMap] because it is available both on Android and in
 * the JVM unit-test runtime.  Once a SparseArray/BitSet implementation is available in both
 * runtimes, the storage can be switched without changing callers.
